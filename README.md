Phylogenetic Analysis 
The alignment shows extremely high conservation (indicated by the asterisks * at the bottom). This confirms that the Hsp70 protein is a highly conserved gene because its role in protecting cells from heat is essential for survival across species.
The tree shows that Drosophila melanogaster is most closely related to Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana. This forms a tight cluster, indicating a recent common ancestor.
Species like Drosophila ficusphila and Drosophila takahashii branch off further back, showing more evolutionary distance from the melanogaster group.
Drosophila elegans appears as a more distant relative in this specific set, representing an earlier divergence in the lineage.
