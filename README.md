protein protein interaction 
The network reveals that Hsp70Aa is a central "hub" protein. Key interaction partners include:
Hsp83: Another major chaperone involved in protein maturation.

Stip1: An adapter protein that coordinates Hsp70 and Hsp90.

Droj2: A co-chaperone that stimulates Hsp70 ATPase activity.

Trap1: A mitochondrial HSP90-like protein.
Biological Processes: Protein folding (GO:0006457), Response to heat (GO:0009408), and Cellular response to heat (GO:0034605).

Molecular Functions: Unfolded protein binding (GO:0051082) and ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone (GO:0140662).
The high number of connections (edges) in the STRING network confirms that Hsp70Aa does not function in isolation. Its primary biological significance lies in its role as a molecular chaperone. By interacting with co-chaperones like Droj2 and other heat shock proteins like Hsp83, it forms a multi-protein complex called the "chaperome." This network is essential for maintaining proteostasis (protein homeostasis) by refolding denatured proteins or targeting irreversibly damaged proteins for degradation, especially under environmental stress.
