Protein Analysis 
molecular weight: 70159.96
instability index: 41.41
aliphatic index: 79.66
pI: 5.54
Domain (PRK00290.1): Identified across the primary sequence.
ATPase Domain (NBD): Located at the N-terminus; responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis which drives the chaperone cycle.
Substrate Binding Domain (SBD): Located at the C-terminus; binds to unfolded or misfolded polypeptides.
The protein consists of a complex mix of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The long "tail" or linker region shows lower confidence, typical of flexible protein segments.
Functional Prediction: Based on the identified ASKHA_NBD and HSP70_peptide-binding domains, this protein functions as a molecular chaperone. It uses energy from ATP to assist in protein folding and prevent aggregation during thermal stress.
