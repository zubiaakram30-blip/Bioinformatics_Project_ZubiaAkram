Subcellular localization 
Prediction Results (CELLO):
Primary Localization: Cytoplasmic.

Reliability Score: 2.835 (Significant).

Secondary Possibilities: Mitochondrial (0.735) and Nuclear (0.486).
As a heat shock protein, Hsp70Aa is primarily located in the cytoplasm to assist with protein folding and to prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins during thermal stress. The secondary nuclear score is consistent with the known behavior of Hsp70 proteins, which can migrate to the nucleus during severe heat shock to protect nuclear machinery.
TargetP: Confirms there is no strong N-terminal signal peptide, which is typical for proteins that stay in the main cell compartment.
