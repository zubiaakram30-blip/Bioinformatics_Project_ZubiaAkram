Subcellular localization 
Prediction Results (CELLO):
Primary Localization: Cytoplasmic.

Reliability Score: 2.835 (Significant).

Secondary Possibilities: Mitochondrial (0.735) and Nuclear (0.486).
As a heat shock protein, Hsp70Aa is primarily located in the cytoplasm to assist with protein folding and to prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins during thermal stress. The secondary nuclear score is consistent with the known behavior of Hsp70 proteins, which can migrate to the nucleus during severe heat shock to protect nuclear machinery.
TargetP: Confirms there is no strong N-terminal signal peptide, which is typical for proteins that stay in the main cell compartment.
Protein Analysis 
molecular weight: 70159.96
instability index: 41.41
aliphatic index: 79.66
pI: 5.54
Domain (PRK00290.1): Identified across the primary sequence.
ATPase Domain (NBD): Located at the N-terminus; responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis which drives the chaperone cycle.
Substrate Binding Domain (SBD): Located at the C-terminus; binds to unfolded or misfolded polypeptides.
The protein consists of a complex mix of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The long "tail" or linker region shows lower confidence, typical of flexible protein segments.
Functional Prediction: Based on the identified ASKHA_NBD and HSP70_peptide-binding domains, this protein functions as a molecular chaperone. It uses energy from ATP to assist in protein folding and prevent aggregation during thermal stress.
