RNA Analysis
The minimum free energy is -636.80 kcal/mol thats why rnafold structure is highly stable due to a high frequency of G-C base pairs (which have three hydrogen bonds) and the formation of multiple stem-loop structures. This stability is crucial for the mRNA to persist in the cell during heat stress.
5' UTR is:
Coordinates: Base 1 to Base 480.
Significance: This long leader sequence is characteristic of heat shock genes
Start CodonATG is at Positions 481–483
