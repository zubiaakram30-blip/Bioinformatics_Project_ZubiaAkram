Gene Identification: Confirmed the sequence as Hsp70Aa via NCBI BLAST with 100% identity.
The mRNA secondary structure was predicted using RNAfold, revealing a highly stable structure (Minimum Free Energy: -636.80 kcal/mol) due to frequent G-C base pairs.
Regulatory Features: Identified a long 5' UTR (Base 1 to 480) and the Start Codon (ATG) at positions 481–483.
Physicochemical Properties: The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 70159.96 and instability index 41.41
Domains: Analysis via InterPro identified a conserved ATPase Domain (NBD) at the N-terminus for ATP hydrolysis and a Substrate Binding Domain (SBD) at the C-terminus.
Structure: The AlphaFold 3D model shows a complex mix of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with a flexible "linker" region between the two main domains.
Subcellular Location: Both CELLO (Reliability: 2.835) and TargetP confirm that Hsp70Aa is primarily Cytoplasmic.
Phylogenetics: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) shows extreme conservation (indicated by asterisks *) across the Drosophila genus, highlighting its essential role in survival.
Network: STRING analysis reveals a dense interaction network with co-chaperones (like Droj2) and other heat shock proteins (Hsp83).
Biological Significance: This protein acts as an "emergency responder" during thermal stress, binding to unfolded proteins to prevent aggregation and ensure cellular proteostasis.
